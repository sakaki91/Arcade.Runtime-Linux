# Teknoparrot.Core-Linux

This project is 100% free and open source, and aims to help preserve arcade game emulation in a way that is compatible with the Linux kernel, trying to decouple it as much as possible from the Windows NT kernel.  
We also __DO NOT USE illegal dumps__ (always use your *legal dumps!*), and we __DO NOT USE proprietary code__ from the __[Teknoparrot](https://teknoparrot.com/en/)__ project, And this works like a translator, a __Linux-Wrapper__ that translates an __NT-Wrapper__.

__Be patient if something doesn't work (this is quite common), I'm doing this on my own, and I'm really trying.__

## Setup:

### WARNING!  
 In several games (especially those that use Lua, such as some WMMTs), it is necessary and highly recommended to enable EN_US in locale.gen, because otherwise certain games simply won't work due to localization errors, which can be explained below:

    $ sudo nano /etc/locale.gen

Check if the en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8 doesn't have a "#" in front of it, if it does, just uncomment it and run:

    $ sudo locale-gen

After that, you should see something similar to this:

    [user@host]$ sudo locale-gen
    Generating locales...
    en_US.UTF-8... done
    Generation complete.

And now you can proceed with the automatic/manual installation!

First, we will create a basic folder structure in your user folder:

    $ cd ~
    $ mkdir -p Teknoparrot/{PROGRAM,PREFIX,TMP}
    $ cd Teknoparrot/TMP
    
The guide uses UMU-Proton 100%, and recently discontinued the priority use of WineGE, so first install (UMU-Proton)[https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher#installing-as-user] as --user-install!

Let's start preparing the prefix and installing the dependencies:

    $ export WINEPREFIX=$HOME/Teknoparrot/PREFIX
    $ ~/.local/bin/umu-run wineboot
    $ wget -c https://aka.ms/dotnet/8.0/dotnet-runtime-win-x64.exe
    $ wget -c https://aka.ms/dotnet/8.0/windowsdesktop-runtime-win-x64.exe
    $ wget -c https://github.com/nzgamer41/TPBootstrapper/releases/latest/download/TPBootstrapper.zip
    $ ~/.local/bin/umu-run dotnet-runtime-win-x64.exe
    $ ~/.local/bin/umu-run windowsdesktop-runtime-win-x64.exe
    $ unzip TPBootstrapper.zip -d ~/Teknoparrot/PROGRAM
    $ ~/.local/bin/umu-run ~/Teknoparrot/PROGRAM/TPBootstrapper.exe

Following this, you should be able to use Teknoparrot normally. 

Below is an example of how the program would run:

__UMUProton__ (Local Installed):

    $ LC_ALL=C LC_NUMERIC=C LANG=en_US.UTF-8 WINEPREFIX=$HOME/Teknoparrot/PREFIX $HOME/.local/bin/umu-run $HOME/Teknoparrot/PROGRAM/TeknoparrotUi.exe

## Auto Install:

Script dependencies: `git, bash, unzip, make (umu-run needs to be compiled locally.), tar, zenity, wget`

    $ cd ~/
    $ git clone https://github.com/sakaki91/Teknoparrot.Core-Linux/
    $ cd Teknoparrot.Core-Linux/
    $ chmod +x install.sh
    $ ./install.sh
 
## About the Project:

#### __What is the GPL license and why does the project have it?__  
It is present in the project precisely to protect the wrapper from any "destructive" intentions on the part of private companies, it is there to protect the code from being transformed into a "closed box" or something similar to a paywall, as we have seen happen with some projects in the past.  
The culture must be FREE and ACCESSIBLE to everyone, regardless of their financial condition or level of support, with security, transparency and, above all, respect for both the user's machine and the person behind the screen.
